## API Integration

This project utilizes the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for fetching accurate and up-to-date weather data.

To run the app locally, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace the placeholder in `script.js`:

```javascript
let apikey = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY";
```

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your-username` and `YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` with your actual GitHub username and OpenWeatherMap API key.
